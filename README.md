# Synthetic Data Generative Models for DC Government Transaction Data

## Abstract
Privacy preservation is essential in the era of big data analytics, particularly when managing sensitive transaction data. In this paper, we present a project that leverages state-of-the-art synthetic data generative models to ensure privacy, prevent cross-referencing of datasets, and promote data augmentation and sharing for Washington DC government transaction data. We trained one self-created baseline model and five advanced generative models, including Synthpop CART and CGAN Model, using Python. The performance of these models was assessed by comparing synthetic data quality and utility in preserving statistical properties through statistical analysis, and by evaluating the effectiveness of machine learning detectors, such as logistic regression and XGboost classifiers, in distinguishing real and synthetic data. Our evaluation centered on key metrics, including data distribution, pairwise correlation, and utility preservation. Experimental results demonstrated that both VAEs and GANs generated synthetic datasets with high utility; however, VAEs surpassed GANs in data quality and statistical property preservation. Our findings offer valuable insights into the efficiency of various generative models in preserving privacy and maintaining data utility for statistical analysis and machine learning applications.
